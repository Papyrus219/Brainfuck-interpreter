Simple brainfuck interpreter.

How to compile?
Just simply write in consol CMake -B build and then make(or ninja if you prefere.).

How tu use?
You must run program from console. As arguments you should give path/s to brainfuck source files. You can give as many as you want, program will combine it in one long script. Source files can be in any text file format (not only .bf). Program will check if all brackets have pair and run program. While running it will check (this function is still in development) if theres no any infinite loops and raport it.

Why?
I was little bored lol. But i will glad for feedback (Its my first program where I use argc and argv).
